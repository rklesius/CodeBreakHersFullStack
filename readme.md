<h1>Purpose of Repository</h1>
<p>
    I created this small webpage to demonstrate how to view a password in any website (i.e. Facebook, Youtube, Gmail) that is normally concealed 
    with a "type="password"".  I did this for demonstration purposes so I wouldn't have to reveal one of my own passwords on one of these sites.
